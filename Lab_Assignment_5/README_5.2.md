## Introduction
This project demonstrates sequence text prediction using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The goal is to generate text sequences by training an LSTM model on a chosen dataset, and then evaluate its performance by analyzing the generated texts and training metrics.

## Project Overview
The project follows a research-based approach to replicate the methodology presented in a seminal paper on LSTM-based sequence prediction. The assignment is divided into several parts:
- **Paper and Dataset Selection**
- **Environment Setup**
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
- **Model Implementation**
- **Training and Evaluation**
- **Analysis and Discussion**
- **Demonstration and Documentation**

Each part builds on the previous one to deliver a cohesive solution.

## Research Paper Summary
**Chosen Research Paper:**  
[Generating Sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850) by Alex Graves

**Core Ideas:**
- Uses deep LSTM networks for sequence generation tasks.
- Explores the application of LSTMs in generating sequential data such as handwriting and text.
- Implements multi-layer architectures and addresses issues like gradient clipping and overfitting using dropout.

The paper provides the theoretical foundation for our LSTM model, making it an ideal reference for our implementation.

## Dataset Details
**Chosen Dataset:**  
Shakespeareâ€™s Text from TensorFlow Datasets

**Dataset Description:**  
This dataset comprises texts from the works of William Shakespeare. It is selected due to its rich and varied language, making it suitable for training and evaluating sequence prediction models.

**Dataset Source:**  
[Shakespeare Dataset on TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tiny_shakespeare)

The dataset is loaded directly using the `tensorflow_datasets` library.

## Environment Setup
The project environment is built using Python along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow (with Keras)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow Datasets

A `requirements.txt` file is included to specify the necessary packages and versions. Environment setup details are provided in the respective project part.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
The data pipeline includes:
- Downloading the Shakespeare dataset using `tensorflow_datasets`.
- Concatenating and exploring the text data to understand its structure.
- Implementing a data preprocessing pipeline that includes:
  - Cleaning the text.
  - Tokenization at a character level.
  - Mapping characters to indices.
  - Creating input-target sequences for model training.

Each step of preprocessing is documented and the code is modularized for clarity.

## Model Implementation
The model is implemented using a stateful LSTM architecture (with the Functional API) and includes:
- An **Embedding Layer** to transform the input text into dense vector representations.
- Two stacked **LSTM Layers** with dropout for regularization.
- A final **Dense Layer** to project the output to the vocabulary size using softmax activation.

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy as the loss function, following best practices from the research paper.

## Training and Evaluation
The training process includes:
- Configuring hyperparameters such as `BATCH_SIZE`, `EPOCHS`, and `BUFFER_SIZE`.
- Preparing the training dataset with proper shuffling and batching.
- Training the model using `model.fit()` along with callbacks:
  - **ModelCheckpoint** to save the best model.
  - **EarlyStopping** to halt training when no improvements are observed.

After training, the model is evaluated using a text generation function that:
- Resets the model's state.
- Generates text by sampling from the predicted probability distributions iteratively.
- Provides sample outputs for qualitative evaluation.

Visualizations such as training loss curves are generated to support the evaluation.

## Analysis and Discussion
### Model Analysis
- **Training Curves:**  
  The training loss decreases over epochs, indicating that the model is learning the underlying patterns in the data.
- **Text Generation:**  
  Generated text samples are compared with expected outputs from the research paper to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Observations:**  
  The analysis section discusses convergence behavior, overfitting issues, and potential improvements.

### Limitations and Future Work
- **Limitations:**  
  - Potential repetitive patterns in generated text.
  - Model complexity and training time could be improved.
- **Future Work:**  
  - Experimentation with Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models.
  - Explore different tokenization methods (e.g., word-level).
  - Hyperparameter tuning and integration of more advanced architectures like Transformers.

## Demonstration and Documentation
The project is comprehensively documented:
- All code includes detailed inline comments and docstrings.
- Visualizations including training plots and generated text samples are saved and embedded in the report.
- A detailed analysis of model performance, limitations, and future work is provided within the repository.
